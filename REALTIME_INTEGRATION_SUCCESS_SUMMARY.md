## 📋 Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Architecture
```dart
// Unified WebSocket service
UnifiedRealtimeApiService
├── RealtimeApiStreams (endpoint-specific streams)
├── RealtimeApiMixin (repository integration)
└── RealtimeBlocHelper (UI integration)

// Enhanced repositories using decorator pattern
RealtimeProjectRepositoryWrapper
├── implements EnhancedProjectRepository
├── wraps ApiProjectRepository
└── adds real-time update streams
```

### Dependency Injection
```dart
// All critical services registered
@LazySingleton() ApiClient
@Injectable() ApiProjectRepository  
@Injectable(as: EnhancedProjectRepository) RealtimeProjectRepositoryWrapper
@Injectable(as: TaskRemoteDataSource) TaskRemoteDataSourceImpl
@Injectable(as: NetworkInfo) NetworkInfoImpl
```

### Key Features Working
- ✅ Real-time project updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Cache-busting for fresh data requests
- ✅ Fallback to traditional HTTP when real-time unavailable
- ✅ Error handling and connection state management
- ✅ Debug logging and monitoring
- ✅ SignalR integration for legacy compatibility

## 🎯 Real-time Capabilities Now Available

### For Developers
```dart
// Easy real-time integration for any repository
class MyRepository with RealtimeApiMixin {
  @override
  String get endpointName => 'my-endpoint';
  
  void initRealtime() {
    startRealtimeUpdates<MyUpdateType>(
      onUpdate: (update) => handleUpdate(update),
      onError: (error) => handleError(error),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
// Enhanced BLoC with real-time updates
class MyBloc extends Bloc<MyEvent, MyState> with RealtimeBlocMixin {
  MyBloc(this.repository) : super(MyInitial()) {
    // Standard BLoC events
    on<LoadData>(_onLoadData);
    
    // Real-time integration
    setupRealtimeUpdates(
      repository.realtimeUpdates,
      (update) => add(RealtimeUpdateReceived(update)),
    );
  }
}
```

## 📊 Performance & Monitoring

## 🏁 Conclusion

The real-time API update system has been **successfully implemented and is fully operational**. The Flutter app starts cleanly, all dependencies are resolved, and real-time updates are working for the project management system. The architecture is modular and can be easily extended to other features as needed.

**The core requirement has been met**: A robust, modular, and efficient real-time update system is now integrated into the Flutter codebase, with the project list screen making fresh API requests on refresh and supporting real-time updates.
