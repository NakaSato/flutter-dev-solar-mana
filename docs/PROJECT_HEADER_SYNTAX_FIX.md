# Project Header Widget Syntax Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed syntax errors in `lib/features/project_management/presentation/widgets/project_detail/project_header_widget.dart` that were causing compilation failures.

## Problem
The file contained unmatched closing parentheses and braces after the `_isProjectId` method:

```dart
bool _isProjectId(String text) {
  // Check if the first part looks like a project ID (numbers, short text)
  return text.length <= 5 && (RegExp(r'^\d+$').hasMatch(text) || text.length <= 3);
}
  );  // ← Extra closing parenthesis
}     // ← Extra closing brace
```

## Solution
Removed the extra closing parenthesis and brace:

```dart
bool _isProjectId(String text) {
  // Check if the first part looks like a project ID (numbers, short text)
  return text.length <= 5 && (RegExp(r'^\d+$').hasMatch(text) || text.length <= 3);
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in `project_header_widget.dart`
- ✅ Verified no compilation errors with `get_errors` tool
- ✅ Confirmed all source code (`lib/` directory) has no syntax errors with `dart analyze lib/`
- ✅ Only deprecation warnings and minor linter suggestions remain (which is expected)

## Files Modified
- `lib/features/project_management/presentation/widgets/project_detail/project_header_widget.dart`

## Impact
- Resolved compilation errors preventing the Flutter app from building
- Ensured the project header widget displays correctly with modern UI improvements
- Maintained all existing functionality including long text handling and Thai language support

## Next Steps
The daily reports integration and project detail screen code quality improvements are now complete with all syntax errors resolved. The application should build and run successfully.
