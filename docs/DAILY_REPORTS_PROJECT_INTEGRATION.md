### Data Filtering
```dart
// Filter reports by project
_dailyReportsCubit.loadDailyReports(
  filters: DailyReportsFilterParams(
    projectId: project.projectId,
    pageSize: 10, // Limit for recent reports view
  ),
);

// Filter by user for user role
final userReports = state.reports
    .where((report) => report.technicianId == user.userId)
    .take(3)
    .toList();
```

### Navigation Integration
```dart
// Navigate to create daily report
Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => BlocProvider.value(
      value: _dailyReportsCubit,
      child: const CreateDailyReportScreen(),
    ),
  ),
).then((_) => _loadProjectDailyReports()); // Refresh on return
```

## ðŸš€ Result

- âœ… Complete daily reports integration
- âœ… Role-based access control
