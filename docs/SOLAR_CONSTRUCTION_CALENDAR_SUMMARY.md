- **Resource-Based Organization**: Tasks grouped by assigned teams
- **Multiple Timeline Scales**: Day, Week, and Month timeline views
- **Rich Task Appointments**:
  - Progress bars integrated into timeline appointments
  - Priority and status color coding
  - Team assignment indicators
  - Duration displays
- **Interactive Legend**: Visual legend explaining color codes for status and priority

### 6. **Enhanced Construction Task Entity** (`construction_task.dart`)

  - Basic task information (ID, title, description, dates)
  - Progress tracking (percentage, status, priority)
  - Team management (assigned team, estimated/actual hours)
  - Materials and dependencies tracking
  - Audit trail (completed by, completion date)
- **Smart Properties**:
  - Calculated duration, active status, overdue detection
  - Color mappings for status and priority
  - Estimated completion date calculations
- **Immutable Design**: Full copyWith implementation for safe state updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Compliance
- **Feature-First Organization**: All construction features properly organized within the work_calendar feature
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of domain entities, presentation widgets, and application logic
- **BLoC Pattern**: Integration with existing state management patterns
- **Material Design 3**: Consistent theming and color schemes

### Data Integration
- **Sample Data**: Realistic 8-task solar installation project timeline including:
  - Site Survey & Assessment
  - Roof Preparation
  - Panel Mounting System
  - Solar Panel Installation
  - Electrical Wiring
  - Inverter Installation
  - System Testing
  - Final Inspection
- **Task Dependencies**: Logical sequencing of construction phases
- **Team Assignments**: Different teams for different specialties (Survey, Installation, Electrical, QA)

### Visual Design Elements
- **Color Coding System**:
  - **Status Colors**: Grey (Not Started), Blue (In Progress), Green (Completed), Orange (Delayed), Purple (On Hold), Dark Grey (Cancelled)
  - **Priority Colors**: Light Green (Low), Orange (Medium), Deep Orange (High), Red (Critical)
- **Progress Visualization**: Multiple progress indicators throughout the interface
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear tab structure with construction-specific features
- **Context-Aware Actions**: Different FABs based on current view
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade and slide animations for dialog transitions
- **Interactive Elements**: Tappable progress cards, status filters, and timeline elements
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Success/error messages for all user actions

## Integration with Existing Features

### Seamless Calendar Integration
- **Unified Interface**: Construction tasks appear alongside regular work events
- **Consistent Theming**: Follows the app's existing color scheme and typography
- **State Management**: Integrates with existing BLoC patterns without conflicts
- **Navigation**: Preserves existing calendar navigation and view switching

### Data Source Compatibility
- **Dual Data Sources**: Handles both construction tasks and work events in the same calendar
- **Flexible Rendering**: Different appointment builders for different data types
- **Event Interactions**: Consistent tap handling for both task and event types

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real construction project management APIs
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live progress updates
3. **Photo Documentation**: Image attachments for task completion verification
