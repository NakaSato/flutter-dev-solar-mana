# WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) Integration - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) system for the Flutter Solar Project Management app. The WBS feature provides hierarchical task management with Material 3 UI, following Clean Architecture principles.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Domain Layer
**Entities Created:**
- `WbsTask` - Core task entity with full properties (ID, name, status, priority, dates, cost, etc.)
- `WbsStructure` - Container for the complete WBS tree with statistics
- `WbsProgress` - Progress tracking entities (WbsProgressSummary, WbsPhaseProgress, etc.)
- Supporting enums: `WbsTaskStatus`, `WbsTaskType`, `WbsTaskPriority`, `WbsAttachmentType`

**Repository Interface:**
- `WbsRepository` - Comprehensive interface with 20+ methods covering:
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Status management
  - File attachments/evidence
  - Progress tracking
  - Dependencies management
  - Bulk operations
  - Search and filtering
  - Task templates and cloning

### 2. Use Cases
**Implemented Use Cases:**
- `GetProjectWbs` - Retrieve WBS structure for a project
- `GetWbsTask` - Get individual task details
- `CreateWbsTask` - Create new WBS tasks
- `UpdateWbsTask` - Update existing tasks
- `UpdateTaskStatus` - Change task status with notes
- `DeleteWbsTask` - Remove tasks from WBS

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
**API Service:**
- `WBSApiService` - Complete API client with endpoints for:
  - Project WBS retrieval with filtering
  - Task CRUD operations
  - Status updates
  - Evidence/file uploads
  - Progress reporting
  - Dependency management
  - Bulk operations

**Repository Implementation:**
- `WbsRepositoryImpl` - Full implementation of WbsRepository interface
- Error handling with proper failure types
- Client-side filtering for missing backend endpoints
- JSON parsing and model conversion

### 4. Application Layer
**State Management:**
- `WbsCubit` - BLoC pattern implementation for WBS state management
- States: `WbsInitial`, `WbsLoading`, `WbsLoaded`, `WbsError`
- Actions: Load WBS, select tasks, update status, create/update/delete tasks
- Optimistic UI updates with tree structure manipulation

### 5. Presentation Layer
**Screens:**
- `WbsScreen` - Main WBS management screen with responsive design
- Tablet layout: Two-pane with tree view and task details
- Mobile layout: Single pane with bottom sheet for task details

**Widgets:**
- `WbsTreeWidget` - Hierarchical task tree with expand/collapse functionality
- `WbsTaskDetailsWidget` - Comprehensive task detail view with editing capabilities
- `WbsProgressWidget` - Progress visualization with statistics and charts

**UI Features:**
- Material 3 design system
- Responsive layouts (mobile/tablet)
- Status indicators with color coding
- Progress bars and completion percentages
- Task hierarchy visualization
- Attachment management
- Quick status updates via popup menus

### 6. Dependency Injection
**DI Configuration:**
- `WbsDI` - Dependency injection configuration for WBS module
- Registered all services, repositories, and use cases
- Integrated into main application DI system

### 7. API Integration
**Configuration:**
- Added `wbsEndpoint` to `ApiConfig`
- API methods for all WBS operations following RESTful conventions
- File upload support for task evidence

- ✅ Bulk operations capability
- ✅ Search and filtering

## 🔗 Integration Points

### API Endpoints Implemented
```
GET    /api/v1/wbs/projects/{id}/wbs     - Get project WBS
GET    /api/v1/wbs/tasks/{id}            - Get task details
POST   /api/v1/wbs/projects/{id}/wbs/tasks - Create task
PUT    /api/v1/wbs/tasks/{id}            - Update task
PATCH  /api/v1/wbs/tasks/{id}/status     - Update task status
