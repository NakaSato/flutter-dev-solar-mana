### Key Components

#### **Domain Layer**
- `WorkRequest` entity with comprehensive properties
- `ApprovalHistory` for audit trail
- `ApprovalStatistics` for dashboard metrics
- `ProcessApprovalRequest`, `EscalateRequest`, etc. for actions
- Repository interface defining all operations

#### **Application Layer**
- `MyWorkRequestsCubit` - Manages user's requests state
- `PendingApprovalsCubit` - Handles approvals list state
- `ProcessApprovalCubit` - Manages approval decision flow

#### **Infrastructure Layer**
- `MockWorkRequestService` - Simulates backend API calls
- `MockWorkRequestApprovalRepository` - Repository implementation
- Proper error handling with `Either<Failure, Success>` pattern

#### **Presentation Layer**
- Responsive Material Design 3 UI
- Custom widgets for cards, status indicators, etc.
- Proper state management integration
- Loading states and error handling

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Material Design 3 Implementation
- Color scheme usage for consistent theming
- Proper elevation and surface tinting
- Semantic color roles (primary, secondary, error, etc.)
- 4dp grid system spacing

### Interactive Elements
- Pull-to-refresh on list screens
- Bulk selection with visual feedback
- Form validation with error messages
- Loading indicators and success feedback
- Modal dialogs for confirmations

### Status Visualization
- Color-coded status chips
- Priority indicators
- Progress timelines
- Days pending badges with urgency colors
- Interactive charts and metrics

## 📊 Mock Data Structure

### Sample Work Requests
The implementation includes realistic mock data with:
- Solar Panel Maintenance (Pending)
- Inverter Replacement (High Priority)
- Wiring Repair (Critical/Draft)
- Monitoring System (Approved)
- Battery Storage (Rejected)

### Approval History
Complete audit trail with:
- Action types (Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Escalated)
- Approver information
- Timestamps
- Comments and rejection reasons

## 🚀 Integration

### Navigation Integration
- Added "Approvals" tab to main app navigation
- Deep linking support with go_router
- Proper tab state management

### State Management
- BLoC/Cubit pattern implementation
- Proper separation of concerns
- Error handling with user feedback
- Loading states for better UX

## 🔄 User Workflows

1. View "My Work Requests"
2. Submit draft requests for approval
3. Track approval status and history
4. Receive feedback through comments

### For Managers/Admins:
1. View "Pending Approvals"
2. Process individual requests (approve/reject)
3. Use bulk actions for efficiency
4. Escalate complex requests
5. Monitor dashboard metrics
