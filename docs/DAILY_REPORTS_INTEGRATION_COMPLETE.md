## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```dart
// Daily reports cubit integrated in project detail screen
late DailyReportsCubit _dailyReportsCubit;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _dailyReportsCubit = getIt<DailyReportsCubit>();
  _loadProjectDailyReports();
}

void _loadProjectDailyReports() {
  _dailyReportsCubit.loadReports(FilterParams(
    projectId: widget.project.id,
    // Additional filters as needed
  ));
}
```

### Real Data Display
```dart
BlocBuilder<DailyReportsCubit, DailyReportsState>(
  bloc: _dailyReportsCubit,
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is DailyReportsLoading) {
      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    } else if (state is DailyReportsLoaded) {
      final reports = state.reports;
      // Display real reports data
      return _buildReportsList(reports);
    } else if (state is DailyReportsError) {
      return Center(child: Text('Error: ${state.message}'));
    }
    return const SizedBox.shrink();
  },
)
```

### Context-Aware Navigation
```dart
void _navigateToDailyReports(Project project) {
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => BlocProvider.value(
        value: _dailyReportsCubit,
        child: DailyReportsScreen(projectId: project.id),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
