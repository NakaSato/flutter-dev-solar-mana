## Implementing New Features

When adding a new feature:

1. Create a new directory under `lib/features/`
2. Follow the established folder structure
3. Maintain Clean Architecture principles
4. Document the feature in this directory structure

For detailed implementation guidelines, see the [Feature Development Guide](../guides/feature_development.md).
