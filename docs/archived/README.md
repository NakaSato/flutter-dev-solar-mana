# Archived Documentation

This directory contains completed implementation summaries and historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for reference.

## 📁 Directory Contents

### 🔄 Code Quality Improvements
- [CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md](./CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md) - Initial code quality improvements
- [CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY_V2.md](./CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY_V2.md) - Second round of code quality improvements

## 📋 Archive Purpose

These documents represent **completed work** that was documented during the development process. They are archived here for:

- **Historical Reference**: Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining context for future development
- **Documentation Completeness**: Keeping a complete record of all improvements

## 🎯 Status

All items in this archive represent **successfully completed** implementations that are now part of the active codebase.

## 📚 Active Documentation

For current and actively maintained documentation, see:

- [Implementation Documentation](../implementation/) - Current implementation details
- [Features Documentation](../features/) - Feature-specific documentation
- [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/) - System architecture guides

## 🔄 Archive Policy

Documents are moved to this archive when:

- ✅ Implementation is complete and stable
- ✅ Documentation is no longer actively updated
- ✅ Content is primarily historical/reference material
- ✅ Active documentation exists elsewhere for ongoing work

## 📖 Reading These Documents

When reviewing archived documentation:

1. **Check Date**: Note when the work was completed
2. **Verify Current State**: Compare with current codebase if needed
3. **Use for Context**: Understand why certain decisions were made
4. **Reference Only**: Don't use as current implementation guide
