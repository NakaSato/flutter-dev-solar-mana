## üìã Archive Purpose

These documents represent **completed work** that was documented during the development process. They are archived here for:

- **Historical Reference**: Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining context for future development
- **Documentation Completeness**: Keeping a complete record of all improvements
- **Decision Context**: Understanding why certain implementation decisions were made

## üéØ Status

All items in this archive represent **successfully completed** implementations that are now part of the active codebase.

## üìö Active Documentation

For current and actively maintained documentation, see:

- [Implementation Documentation](../../implementation/) - Current implementation guides
- [Features Documentation](../../features/) - Feature-specific documentation
- [Architecture Documentation](../../architecture/) - System architecture guides
- [API Documentation](../../api/) - API reference documentation

## üîÑ Usage Guidelines

When reviewing archived documentation:

1. **Check Date**: Note when the work was completed
2. **Verify Current State**: Compare with current codebase if needed
3. **Use for Context**: Understand why certain decisions were made
4. **Reference Only**: Don't use as current implementation guide
